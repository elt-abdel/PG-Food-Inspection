# Let's eat out in the future!

In this project I used NodeJS and ExpressJS to power the back end and pull data from the Prince George's (PG) County Food Safety Data Set. I then rearranged the data from the PG County Food Safety Data Set into a format that will work with the charting library from CanvasJS. I pushed the cleaned data to /api where the front end makes a fetch request and then displays the data in a nice looking chart!
